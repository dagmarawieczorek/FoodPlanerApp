# FoodPlannerApp
## Project of mobile app in React Native using realm native.

 Food Planner will be an app that allows you to plan your whole days and generate shopping lists, that you can edit. It will also show how much will you spend on every meal.
 
 Still lots to do, but it's a start!
 
 what I need to do asap:
1. add Redux to handle the state
2. recipes screen
3. adding recipes to realm

Language is a mix between polish and english right now, but there will be options to pick language and also different food lists
